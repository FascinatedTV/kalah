This is a server implementation of the Kalah Game Protocl (KGP),
written in Go[0].  It implements the base protocol, without any
extensions.  Currently, it only supports the "freeplay" mode.

The only build-dependency is the Go toolchain.  To compile the server,
run

	$ go build

which produces the "kpg-server" binary.

kgp-server requires no external configuration or persistent state.
All options are configured via command line flags.  Invoking

	$ ./kgp-server -help

generates a listing of flags.
