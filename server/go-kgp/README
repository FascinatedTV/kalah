This is a server implementation of the Kalah Game Protocl (KGP),
written in Go[0].  It implements the base protocol, without any
extensions.  Currently, it only supports the "freeplay" and "simple"
mode.

The only build-dependency is the Go toolchain, version 1.16 or newer.
To compile the server, run

	$ go build

which produces the "go-kgp" binary.

The program requires no external configuration or persistent state.
All options are configured via command line flags.  Invoking

	$ ./go-kgp -help

generates a listing of flags.
