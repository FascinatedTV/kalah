Kalah Game Protocol Java library

Maintainer: Tobias VÃ¶lk <tobias.voelk@fau.de>

To use this library, copy the code in info.kwarc.kalah.jkgp, if
necessary adapting packages and imports at the top of the files.  The
library itself can be modified however you like, as long as it still
communicates as intended.

The files ExampleAgent.java and MinMaxAgent.java give you a template
on how your client should look like.

Happy coding!
