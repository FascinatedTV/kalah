Kalah Game Protocol Java library

Noob guide:
Copy the code in info.kwarc.kalah.jkgp to some directory, adapt packages and imports at the top of the files if necessary.
Read the comments of the ExampleAgent, use it as template, should explain everything.
Look at MinMaxAgent for a more sophisticated example.

Otherwise here's my mail: tobias.voelk@t-online.de

Happy coding!
