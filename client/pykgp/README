This is a client-side library implementation of the Kalah Game Protocl
(KGP), written in Python 3[0].  It implements the base protocol, without
any extensions.  Currently, it assumes the "freeplay" mode.

This library only depends on core Python 3 packages, and thus requires
no external dependencies.  To use, just make sure that kgp.py is in
PYTHONPATH, and import the "kgp" module.

Client examples can be found in the examples/ subdirectory.
